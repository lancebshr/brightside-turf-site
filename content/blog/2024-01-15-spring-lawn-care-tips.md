Spring is the perfect time to give your lawn the attention it deserves after a long winter. Here are our top tips for getting your yard in shape for the warmer months ahead.

## 1. Clean Up Winter Debris

Before you do anything else, take time to clean up any leaves, branches, and other debris that accumulated over the winter. This allows sunlight and air to reach the grass and prevents disease.

## 2. Aerate Your Lawn

Core aeration is one of the best things you can do for your lawn in spring. It helps reduce soil compaction, allowing water, nutrients, and oxygen to reach the grass roots more effectively.

## 3. Overseed Bare Patches

If you notice any bare or thin spots in your lawn, spring is an excellent time to overseed. Choose a grass seed that matches your existing lawn and keep the area moist until the new grass is established.

## 4. Apply Pre-Emergent Herbicide

To prevent weeds from taking over your lawn this summer, apply a pre-emergent herbicide in early spring before weed seeds have a chance to germinate.

## 5. Start a Fertilization Program

A consistent fertilization program is key to a healthy, green lawn. Consider signing up for our professional fertilization service to ensure your lawn gets the nutrients it needs throughout the growing season.
